# LSTM_Routing_Opt
LSTM for Routing Optimization

The objective of this project is to predict the next transmission through a router or switch in a network using LSTM architecture.

## Data Collection

The data is collected and cleaned by me. A high bandwidth router in Telia network is observed for 24 hours and an univariate dataset is created.

### sunday_csv.csv is the values of the selected router observed on a sunday. Similarly, wednesday_csv.csv is the values of the same router observed on a monday.

## Model Preparation

Model is an recurrent neural network with LSTM layer as the input layer.
